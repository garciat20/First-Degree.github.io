<h1>Our Mission</h1>

Our team strives to design a video game to aid the advancement of second world countries. The video game we envision is called First Degree. First Degree’s aim is the social integration of second world countries through video games and a self-integration propagation of modern technologies. Due to the lack of financial resources, or care to invest in technology, their military, or anything else, First Degree is meant to be a cost efficient program to create first world countries out of our targeted audience (second world countries). Our product’s mission is to make complicated technological advances easily understandable and applicable to allow these nations to combat technologically induced issues such as climate change and political stress.
